## About

> Graduate from LJMU with a degree in maths, I attended a coding bootcamp and gained an apprenticeship which I finished with a diploma in software engineering. 

I primarily use Laravel and Vue to create advanced applications that are powerful and easy to use. 
I can also use React and Django for optimized applications with a little bit of machine learning for improved conversion. 
I can then deploy these to an EC2 on AWS giving you a true full stack development.
